abstract: Metacognition is regarded as a retrospective skill promoting learners’
  learning performance, deep thinking, and academic well-being. Stimulated
  Recall (SR) is regarded as a reliable approach to inspiring
  learners’metacognition in the classroom. However, the outbreak of COVID-19,
  causing widespread class suspension, may impair the effect of SR on
  cultivating distance learners’metacognition. The current study, employing
  multi-mode stimuli of learners’eye movements and feedforward, aimed to develop
  the effect of SR on activating learners’metacognition in remote settings.
  Forty-eight university graduates were recruited to participate in an
  eye-tracking experiment using digital dictionaries. Their feedforward and eye
  movements were collected as multi-mode stimuli. By reviewing the consistency
  and discrepancies between their feedforward and eye movements, participants
  were invited to conduct an SR interview, which stimulated them to retrospect
  on their prior cognitive behaviors. The results of the metacognition scale
  pre-post test showed that learners’ metacognitive skills were significantly
  improved by the stimulated recall with multi-mode stimuli. The findings
  theoretically enrich the metacognition strategy in the Cognitive Theories of
  Multimedia Learning, and practically extend the implementation of stimulated
  recall in distance learning contexts.
