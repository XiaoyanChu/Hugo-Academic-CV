abstract: The Metaverse is a network of 3D virtual worlds supporting social connections among its users and enabling them to participate in activities mimicking real life. It merges physical and virtual reality and provides channels for multisensory interactions and immersions in a variety of environments. Metaverse is considered the third wave of the Internet revolution, and it is built on new and emerging technologies such as Extended Reality (XR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Research on the impact of the Metaverse on education exploded in 2022. Here we explore learning across the Metaverse and propose a new and innovative theoretical framework by reviewing literature and synthesizing best practices in designing metaverse learning environments. This Ecosystem consists of four major hubs&#58 A) Instructional design and performance technology hub, B) Knowledge hub, C) Research and technology hub, and D) Talent and training hub. Common to all four hubs are the factors in the three wheels (Fig. 8)&#58 a) Infrastructure, business industry, and communication& #58 b) technology access and equity, and c) user rights, data security, and privacy policy. We believe that this framework can help guide emerging research and development on the applications of Metaverse in education. We also hope this paper can serve as a launch pad for the special issue on Metaverse and the Future of Education supported by the IEEE Education Society.
