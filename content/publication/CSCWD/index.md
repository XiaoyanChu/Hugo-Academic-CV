abstract: The current years have witnessed that educational innovation has been
  increasingly considered as an vital target in education reform and management.
  Many current studies from the perspective of instructive design shed light on
  discussing the approach to inspire the innovative intention and ability among
  the society, while few studies focus on the driving mechanism of enhancing
  instructors' innovation ability in the ear of information, which should be
  paid special attention since innovative ideology and behavior from instructors
  tend to positively influence the participants' innovation. Moreover, few
  research were conducted to explore the influence of interaction between
  instructors and participants on their innovation in the context of “internet
  +” entrepreneurship. The educational crowd-funding model is an approach to
  meet the needs of interactive innovation and entrepreneurship through
  achieving some educational service agreements online, which may be beneficial
  to stimulate instructors' entrepreneurship enthusiasm and enhance their
  interactive capability. It is thus considered that educational crowd-funding
  could both have access to collective wisdom and meet individuals' specific
  needs, among which the innovative ecosystem could be constructed with
  achievement.
